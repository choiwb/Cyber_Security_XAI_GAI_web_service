What is FW?,FW is Firewall.,"a network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. A firewall acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external network, such as the internet, and helps prevent unauthorized access to the internal network by blocking or filtering traffic that does not meet certain criteria."
What is IPS?,IPS is Intrusion Prevention System.,"a network security device that monitors network traffic for signs of malicious activity and can take actions to prevent or stop such activity. An IPS works by inspecting network packets and comparing them to known patterns of malicious traffic, such as known signatures of viruses, malware, or attacks."
What is IDS?,IDS is Intrusion Detection System.,"a network security device or software application that monitors network traffic for signs of malicious activity. An IDS works by inspecting network packets and comparing them to known patterns of malicious traffic, such as known signatures of viruses, malware, or attacks."
What is EDR?,EDR is Endpoint Detection and Response.," a type of security technology that is designed to detect and respond to advanced threats on endpoint devices, such as desktops, laptops, servers, and mobile devices. EDR solutions typically use advanced techniques such as behavioral analysis, machine learning, and threat intelligence to detect and respond to threats that may have evaded other security measures."
What is WAF?,WAF is Web Application Firewall.,"a type of firewall designed specifically to protect web applications from attacks. WAFs sit between the web application and the internet, inspecting and filtering incoming and outgoing web traffic to block attacks and vulnerabilities."
What is WEB?,"WEB, short for World Wide Web.","a system of interconnected documents and resources, accessed through the internet, that are linked together through hyperlinks and URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). The World Wide Web was invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, and has since become an integral part of modern society, with billions of users accessing web-based resources every day."
What is APACHE WEB?,,"Apache Web Server, often referred to simply as ""Apache,"" is an open-source web server software that is used to host and serve web content over the internet.

What is NGINX WEB?,,"NGINX (pronounced ""engine-x"") is an open-source web server software that is used to host and serve web content over the internet. NGINX is known for its high performance, reliability, and scalability, and is widely used by organizations of all sizes to serve web content and manage web traffic."
What is IIS WEB?,,"IIS (Internet Information Services) is a web server software developed by Microsoft and is used to host and serve web content over the internet. IIS is specifically designed to work with Windows operating systems, and is included with most versions of Windows."
What is CVE?,CVE is Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures.,a system used to identify and track publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities and exposures in software and hardware products.
What is Sigma Rule?,,"a flexible and open-source format for describing detection rules used in security information and event management (SIEM) systems, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and other security tools. Sigma rules are designed to be simple, portable, and easy to write, modify, and share."
What is Snort Rule?,,Snort is a widely used open-source intrusion detection and prevention system that can analyze network traffic in real-time to detect and prevent malicious activity. A Snort rule is a text-based rule that describes the conditions for detecting specific types of traffic or activity on a network.
What is YARA Rule?,,YARA is an open-source tool designed to help malware researchers and security professionals identify and classify malware samples based on patterns and rules. YARA rules are text-based and describe patterns or characteristics that can be used to identify a specific type of file or code.
What is Mitre Att&ck matrix?,,a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques that are used during cyberattacks. It is a comprehensive model of real-world attack techniques used by adversaries to compromise and exfiltrate sensitive information from targeted systems.
