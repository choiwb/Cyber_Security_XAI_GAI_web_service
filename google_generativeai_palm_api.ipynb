       "'Command Injections\\nGuy-Vincent Jourdan\\nSchool of Inf. Tech. and Engineering\\nUniversity of Ottawa\\n800 King Edward Avenue\\nOttawa, Ontario, Canada, K1N 6N5\\ngvj@site.uottawa.ca\\nCommand injections\\nIn this section, we ﬁrst deﬁne formally what a command injection vulnerability is, and we then\\nprovide several examples of diﬀerent types of command injections chosen among the most common\\nones at the time of writing.\\nFormal deﬁnition of command injections\\nCommand injections vulnerabilities are common and occur with diﬀerent technologies, current\\nand future. In order to grasp the essence of the problem, we propose here a deﬁnition of command\\ninjections which is technology independent.\\nAssume that we have a virtual machine Mthat accepts programs as input and “executes” these\\nprograms in some way. As it is customary with virtual machines, in order to be executed, the\\nprograms must be “valid”, in that they have to be an element of the input language LMrecognized\\nbyM. The language LMis usually speciﬁed by a grammar GM. Thus, a valid program for a\\nmachine Mis a program recognized by the grammar GM.\\nThe grammar GMhas two types of symbols: the terminal and the non-terminal symbols. Non-\\nterminal symbols can be on both sides of the grammar’s derivation rules, while terminal symbols\\ncan only appear on the right hand side of these rules. A word of LMis made of terminal symbols\\nand can be derived from the rules of GM(see e.g. [9] for an overview of these classical concepts).\\nWhen looking at virtual machines grammars, we can identify two types of terminal symbols in\\nGM: the predeﬁned constants of the language LMand the variables. The predeﬁned constants are\\nthe keywords of the language, the predeﬁned symbols that are interpreted by Mupon execution\\nof a program, while the variables specify values, variable names etc.\\nAssume that an application makes use of such a machine M. That is, the application produces\\na program precognized by GMand sends ptoMfor execution. Assume moreover that pis at least\\npartially produced at runtime, based in part on some user provided input ip. We say that there\\nis a command injection vulnerability (more precisely in that case, an LM-injection vulnerability)if for some inputs ip, the application produces a pcontaining an element from ipthat is going to\\nbe recognized as a predeﬁned constant of the language LMby the grammar GM.\\nDeﬁnition 1 ( LM-injection vulnerability) An application has an LM-injection vulnerability\\nif\\n1. The application uses a virtual machine M.\\n2. It is possible for a user to provide a set of inputs ipto the application that will cause the\\napplication to pass a program ptoM.\\n3. There are in psome elements coming from ipthat will be parsed by the grammar GMas a\\npredeﬁned constant of the language LM.\\nAs Deﬁnition 1 speciﬁes, a command injection vulnerability is a ﬂaw that allows a user, poten-\\ntially malicious, to modify the parsed input of a virtual machine in such a way that the modiﬁed\\nportion of the input is going to be interpreted by the machine as a command. It is called a\\ncommand injection because it reﬂects the ability of the user to inject a “command” that will be\\nexecuted directly by the targeted virtual machine.\\nOur deﬁnition is in practice a bit too broad. Indeed, there are applications that intentionally\\nlet users “drive” some of the virtual machines used by the program, ideally in some limited and\\ncontrolled way. For example, there are numerous Web-based applications that let by design users\\nenter some HTML formatting instructions (such as bold, itemization etc.). Any such possibility\\nwould be ﬂagged as command-injection ﬂaw according to our deﬁnition. Clearly, if the application\\nis meant to allow such input, then this is not an injection “ﬂaw”, although it can still be a\\nsecurity vulnerability1. Our deﬁnition can easily be modiﬁed to account for “application expected\\nmodiﬁcations”, but we do not consider it in this paper for the sake of simplicity.\\nMost software applications make use of such virtual machines at runtime. In fact, a typical\\napplication will use several of these machines, used sometimes independently and sometimes in\\nsequence. Common examples include SQL engines, XML parsers, HTML parsers, scripting engines\\netc. Whenever an command injection vulnerability against a machine Mexists in an application,\\nthe attacker gets some level of control over the execution within M. In the following subsections,\\nwe review some of these injections attacks on practical examples.\\nSQL injections\\nAmong command injections, SQL injections are perhaps the best known and the most studied\\n(see e.g. [1, 2, 5, 8]). A SQL command injection vulnerability can exist whenever an application\\nuses a SQL based database and constructs unﬁltered (or improperly ﬁltered) SQL commands\\nbased on user input. An attacker can then take this opportunity to inject its own SQL command,\\nwhich will be passed down by the application to the SQL-database engine and executed.\\nThe archetype example of a code which presents SQL-injections vulnerabilities is the following\\ncode snippet, where a SQL query is being build on-the-ﬂy based on user provided user name and\\npassword:\\n1It should be noted that applications allowing directly this types of user-level manipulations can often be\\nmisused to allow unexpected command injections. See e.g. [3] for an example of possible consequences of allowing\\nan “<a href=. . . ” tag.LoginQuery = ’’SELECT * FROM UsersTable\\nWHERE UserId=’’’ +\\nrequest.getParameter(’’userName’’) +\\n’’’ AND Password = ’’’ +\\nrequest.getParameter(’’password’’) +\\n’’’;’’;\\nIn this code, “LoginQuery” is built based directly on user-provided inputs (parameters “user-\\nName” and “password”). The intent is to query the database to see if the table “UsersTable”\\ncontains a record where the ﬁeld “UserId” matches the user-provided parameter “userName” and\\nthe ﬁeld “Password” matches the user-provided parameter “password”.\\nBecause the query is built directly by concatenation of predeﬁned commands and user input,\\nmalicious users can actually modify the end query in various ways. For example, the password\\ncheck can be bypassed by providing a password such as ’ OR 1=1; . If the user name provided is\\nadministrator , this will turn the query “LoginQuery” into\\nSELECT * FROM UsersTable WHERE\\nUserId= ’administrator’\\nAND Password = ’’ OR 1=1;\\nThis command will always return the record with a ﬁeld UserId=’administrator’ , regardless\\nof the associated password value.\\nAnother way to manipulate the code above is to insert ’;in the user name or password, followed\\nby any SQL command. Again, this would lead to the execution of that user-provided command,\\nwhich can be any operation (table manipulation, database update etc.) permitted by the access\\nrights of the application on the database.\\nSQL-injections are clearly a particular case of our deﬁnition, where the virtual machine is the\\nSQL-based database engine, and the virtual machine language is SQL. As we can see from the\\nabove examples, an attacker will successfully perform a SQL injection by providing input that\\nwill be interpreted by the database as actual SQL (e.g. the ORin the example above).\\nHTML-browsers injections (HTML, XSS...)\\nHTML-browsers can be the target of several distinct command injections attacks. These in-\\njections where at ﬁrst not really considered harmful since they do not harm the system running\\nthe application in an obvious way; indeed, the application is not what is attacked, it is merely a\\nvector used to send attacks down to the HTML-browsers of the users of the application.\\nWe again consider a trivial example: assume that the application produces an HTML page con-\\ntaining user-provided comments to be displayed in other user’s HTML browsers. These comments\\nare typically stored in a database by another part of the application. Assume that the application\\nhas fetched an existing comment from the database, and stored the user name and comment into\\ntheUsername and Comment variables. Assume that the HTML page showing the user-provided\\ncomments is built from the following server side ASP code:\\n<B><%UserName%></B> says <%Comment%>If a malicious user has given a user name or a comment that include HTML tags, then those\\ntags will be inserted into the resulting page as is and will be directly interpreted by the HTML\\nbrowser of the users viewing the page. This is an example of an HTML-injection, and again\\nclearly a particular case of our general deﬁnition: the virtual machine is the HTML-browser and\\nthe language is HTML. A malicious user successfully attacks such a system by injecting data that\\nwill be interpreted as HTML by the HTML grammar. This can for example be the insertion of a\\nfake login form looking like the one of the application, which lies within a legitimate page of the\\napplication but sends the credential to some other location, controlled by the attacker.\\nIn addition to HTML-injections, HTML-browsers typically have embedded scripting interpreters\\n(such as JavaScript) that can be triggered from within an HTML page. Consider the same example\\nabove, but now with a malicious user entering a comment such as:\\n<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>\\nThis would lead to an HTML-page being created by the application with the JavaScript in-\\nstruction embedded in it, and thus again been interpreted by the HTML-browsers of subsequent\\nusers. This type of attack, known as “cross-site scripting”, or “XSS” [7, 4, 6], can be very serious,\\nsince a successful malicious attacker can get access to the scripting engines embedded into the\\napplication’s users’ HTML-browser, and for example get a hold on their “cookies”, which typically\\nlead to session hijacking. In our model, the virtual machine is the script interpreter embedded\\ninto the HTML-browser, and a successful attack consists of injecting data that will be interpreted\\nas script instructions (JavaScript in our example) by the interpreter. In the example, the injection\\ndid in fact trigger the invocation of the virtual machine, but of course similar example can be\\nconstructed where command injections happen within the scripting engine itself.\\nShell command injections\\nShell command injections vulnerabilities have been historically very important, although they\\nseem to be in decline lately. This type of command injections occurs when the application invokes\\nthe operating system shell (C-shell, Bash etc. on Unix, command shell on Windows etc.) to\\ninitiate another program. For example, the application could be sending an email, and for that\\ncould be using directly the “mail” program under Unix; or, it could be attempting to print with\\nthe “lpr” command. If, as part of this program invocation, the application is using some user\\ndata without proper ﬁltering, then again a malicious user can craft an input that will terminate\\nthe intended command and start another one of the user’s choice.\\nThis type of vulnerabilities used to be very common, presumably due to the Unix philosophy\\nof “piping” applications together and of invoking programs from the command line. Of course,\\na successful shell command injection is potentially catastrophic, since the attacker gets an access\\nto the operating system with the credential of the application.\\nShell command injections are also a particular case of our command injection deﬁnition, where\\nthe virtual machine is the shell itself.\\nOther injections\\nOther types of command injections have been reported: LDAP-injection, XPath injection, XML\\ninjection, macro injection etc. More importantly, there are going to be new types of commandinjections in the future, based on currently unknown technology. All of these types of attack are\\nvariation on the same pattern, so we must develop a defense strategy that is not based on the\\nspeciﬁcity of any given technology.\\nCommands injections versus commands modiﬁcations\\nOne limitation of our deﬁnition and of the strategy described below is that it addresses command\\ninjections vulnerabilities, but does not address command modiﬁcation vulnerabilities. A command\\nmodiﬁcation attack consists of a malicious user modifying a legitimate command to transform it\\ninto an illegitimate one, but without inserting any new instructions. For example, in the case of\\nSQL engines, it would mean to use an existing SELECT command to read diﬀerent records than\\nthe ones intended, or to use a legitimate DELETE command to delete records that should not have\\nbeen deleted. This type of attack is no less harmful than a command injection. It basically follows\\nthe same pattern but is not captured by Deﬁnition 1.\\nIn fact, we argue that command modiﬁcation ﬂaws are of a diﬀerent type entirely. When a\\ncommand is “modiﬁed” in an application, it is the semantics of the application itself that is being\\nabused. A purely syntactic approach such as the one proposed against command injections ﬂaws\\nis not appropriate for such a problem. It does not mean that this type of ﬂaw can be overlooked,\\nbut rather that it will only be caught by an analysis of the inner workings of the application,\\nmuch like the other security-related bugs in the application.\\nReferences\\n[1] C.

Tech. and Engineering\\nUniversity of Ottawa\\n800 King Edward Avenue\\nOttawa, Ontario, Canada, K1N 6N5\\ngvj@site.uottawa.ca\\nCommand injections\\nIn this section, we ﬁrst deﬁne formally what a command injection vulnerability is, and we then\\nprovide several examples of diﬀerent types of command injections chosen among the most common\\nones at the time of writing.\\nFormal deﬁnition of command injections\\nCommand injections vulnerabilities are common and occur with diﬀerent technologies, current\\nand future. In order to grasp the essence of the problem, we propose here a deﬁnition of command\\ninjections which is technology independent.\\nAssume that we have a virtual machine Mthat accepts programs as input and “executes” these\\nprograms in some way. As it is customary with virtual machines, in order to be executed, the\\nprograms must be “valid”, in that they have to be an element of the input language LMrecognized\\nbyM. The language LMis usually speciﬁed by a grammar GM. Thus, a valid program for a\\nmachine Mis a program recognized by the grammar GM.\\nThe grammar GMhas two types of symbols: the terminal and the non-terminal symbols. Non-\\nterminal symbols can be on both sides of the grammar’s derivation rules, while terminal symbols\\ncan only appear on the right hand side of these rules. A word of LMis made of terminal symbols\\nand can be derived from the rules of GM(see e.g. [9] for an overview of these classical concepts).\\nWhen looking at virtual machines grammars, we can identify two types of terminal symbols in\\nGM: the predeﬁned constants of the language LMand the variables. The predeﬁned constants are\\nthe keywords of the language, the predeﬁned symbols that are interpreted by Mupon execution\\nof a program, while the variables specify values, variable names etc.\\nAssume that an application makes use of such a machine M. That is, the application produces\\na program precognized by GMand sends ptoMfor execution. Assume moreover that pis at least\\npartially produced at runtime, based in part on some user provided input ip. We say that there\\nis a command injection vulnerability (more precisely in that case, an LM-injection vulnerability)if for some inputs ip, the application produces a pcontaining an element from ipthat is going to\\nbe recognized as a predeﬁned constant of the language LMby the grammar GM.\\nDeﬁnition 1 ( LM-injection vulnerability) An application has an LM-injection vulnerability\\nif\\n1. The application uses a virtual machine M.\\n2. It is possible for a user to provide a set of inputs ipto the application that will cause the\\napplication to pass a program ptoM.\\n3. There are in psome elements coming from ipthat will be parsed by the grammar GMas a\\npredeﬁned constant of the language LM.\\nAs Deﬁnition 1 speciﬁes, a command injection vulnerability is a ﬂaw that allows a user, poten-\\ntially malicious, to modify the parsed input of a virtual machine in such a way that the modiﬁed\\nportion of the input is going to be interpreted by the machine as a command. It is called a\\ncommand injection because it reﬂects the ability of the user to inject a “command” that will be\\nexecuted directly by the targeted virtual machine.\\nOur deﬁnition is in practice a bit too broad. Indeed, there are applications that intentionally\\nlet users “drive” some of the virtual machines used by the program, ideally in some limited and\\ncontrolled way. For example, there are numerous Web-based applications that let by design users\\nenter some HTML formatting instructions (such as bold, itemization etc.). Any such possibility\\nwould be ﬂagged as command-injection ﬂaw according to our deﬁnition. Clearly, if the application\\nis meant to allow such input, then this is not an injection “ﬂaw”, although it can still be a\\nsecurity vulnerability1. Our deﬁnition can easily be modiﬁed to account for “application expected\\nmodiﬁcations”, but we do not consider it in this paper for the sake of simplicity.\\nMost software applications make use of such virtual machines at runtime. In fact, a typical\\napplication will use several of these machines, used sometimes independently and sometimes in\\nsequence. Common examples include SQL engines, XML parsers, HTML parsers, scripting engines\\netc. Whenever an command injection vulnerability against a machine Mexists in an application,\\nthe attacker gets some level of control over the execution within M. In the following subsections,\\nwe review some of these injections attacks on practical examples.\\nSQL injections\\nAmong command injections, SQL injections are perhaps the best known and the most studied\\n(see e.g. [1, 2, 5, 8]). A SQL command injection vulnerability can exist whenever an application\\nuses a SQL based database and constructs unﬁltered (or improperly ﬁltered) SQL commands\\nbased on user input. An attacker can then take this opportunity to inject its own SQL command,\\nwhich will be passed down by the application to the SQL-database engine and executed.\\nThe archetype example of a code which presents SQL-injections vulnerabilities is the following\\ncode snippet, where a SQL query is being build on-the-ﬂy based on user provided user name and\\npassword:\\n1It should be noted that applications allowing directly this types of user-level manipulations can often be\\nmisused to allow unexpected command injections. See e.g. [3] for an example of possible consequences of allowing\\nan “<a href=. . . ” tag.LoginQuery = ’’SELECT * FROM UsersTable\\nWHERE UserId=’’’ +\\nrequest.getParameter(’’userName’’) +\\n’’’ AND Password = ’’’ +\\nrequest.getParameter(’’password’’) +\\n’’’;’’;\\nIn this code, “LoginQuery” is built based directly on user-provided inputs (parameters “user-\\nName” and “password”). The intent is to query the database to see if the table “UsersTable”\\ncontains a record where the ﬁeld “UserId” matches the user-provided parameter “userName” and\\nthe ﬁeld “Password” matches the user-provided parameter “password”.\\nBecause the query is built directly by concatenation of predeﬁned commands and user input,\\nmalicious users can actually modify the end query in various ways. For example, the password\\ncheck can be bypassed by providing a password such as ’ OR 1=1; . If the user name provided is\\nadministrator , this will turn the query “LoginQuery” into\\nSELECT * FROM UsersTable WHERE\\nUserId= ’administrator’\\nAND Password = ’’ OR 1=1;\\nThis command will always return the record with a ﬁeld UserId=’administrator’ , regardless\\nof the associated password value.\\nAnother way to manipulate the code above is to insert ’;in the user name or password, followed\\nby any SQL command. Again, this would lead to the execution of that user-provided command,\\nwhich can be any operation (table manipulation, database update etc.) permitted by the access\\nrights of the application on the database.\\nSQL-injections are clearly a particular case of our deﬁnition, where the virtual machine is the\\nSQL-based database engine, and the virtual machine language is SQL. As we can see from the\\nabove examples, an attacker will successfully perform a SQL injection by providing input that\\nwill be interpreted by the database as actual SQL (e.g. the ORin the example above).\\nHTML-browsers injections (HTML, XSS...)\\nHTML-browsers can be the target of several distinct command injections attacks. These in-\\njections where at ﬁrst not really considered harmful since they do not harm the system running\\nthe application in an obvious way; indeed, the application is not what is attacked, it is merely a\\nvector used to send attacks down to the HTML-browsers of the users of the application.\\nWe again consider a trivial example: assume that the application produces an HTML page con-\\ntaining user-provided comments to be displayed in other user’s HTML browsers. These comments\\nare typically stored in a database by another part of the application. Assume that the application\\nhas fetched an existing comment from the database, and stored the user name and comment into\\ntheUsername and Comment variables. Assume that the HTML page showing the user-provided\\ncomments is built from the following server side ASP code:\\n<B><%UserName%></B> says <%Comment%>If a malicious user has given a user name or a comment that include HTML tags, then those\\ntags will be inserted into the resulting page as is and will be directly interpreted by the HTML\\nbrowser of the users viewing the page. This is an example of an HTML-injection, and again\\nclearly a particular case of our general deﬁnition: the virtual machine is the HTML-browser and\\nthe language is HTML. A malicious user successfully attacks such a system by injecting data that\\nwill be interpreted as HTML by the HTML grammar. This can for example be the insertion of a\\nfake login form looking like the one of the application, which lies within a legitimate page of the\\napplication but sends the credential to some other location, controlled by the attacker.\\nIn addition to HTML-injections, HTML-browsers typically have embedded scripting interpreters\\n(such as JavaScript) that can be triggered from within an HTML page. Consider the same example\\nabove, but now with a malicious user entering a comment such as:\\n<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>\\nThis would lead to an HTML-page being created by the application with the JavaScript in-\\nstruction embedded in it, and thus again been interpreted by the HTML-browsers of subsequent\\nusers. This type of attack, known as “cross-site scripting”, or “XSS” [7, 4, 6], can be very serious,\\nsince a successful malicious attacker can get access to the scripting engines embedded into the\\napplication’s users’ HTML-browser, and for example get a hold on their “cookies”, which typically\\nlead to session hijacking. In our model, the virtual machine is the script interpreter embedded\\ninto the HTML-browser, and a successful attack consists of injecting data that will be interpreted\\nas script instructions (JavaScript in our example) by the interpreter. In the example, the injection\\ndid in fact trigger the invocation of the virtual machine, but of course similar example can be\\nconstructed where command injections happen within the scripting engine itself.\\nShell command injections\\nShell command injections vulnerabilities have been historically very important, although they\\nseem to be in decline lately. This type of command injections occurs when the application invokes\\nthe operating system shell (C-shell, Bash etc. on Unix, command shell on Windows etc.) to\\ninitiate another program.

Tech. and Engineering\\nUniversity of Ottawa\\n800 King Edward Avenue\\nOttawa, Ontario, Canada, K1N 6N5\\ngvj@site.uottawa.ca\\nCommand injections\\nIn this section, we ﬁrst deﬁne formally what a command injection vulnerability is, and we then\\nprovide several examples of diﬀerent types of command injections chosen among the most common\\nones at the time of writing.\\nFormal deﬁnition of command injections\\nCommand injections vulnerabilities are common and occur with diﬀerent technologies, current\\nand future. In order to grasp the essence of the problem, we propose here a deﬁnition of command\\ninjections which is technology independent.\\nAssume that we have a virtual machine Mthat accepts programs as input and “executes” these\\nprograms in some way. As it is customary with virtual machines, in order to be executed, the\\nprograms must be “valid”, in that they have to be an element of the input language LMrecognized\\nbyM. The language LMis usually speciﬁed by a grammar GM. Thus, a valid program for a\\nmachine Mis a program recognized by the grammar GM.\\nThe grammar GMhas two types of symbols: the terminal and the non-terminal symbols. Non-\\nterminal symbols can be on both sides of the grammar’s derivation rules, while terminal symbols\\ncan only appear on the right hand side of these rules. A word of LMis made of terminal symbols\\nand can be derived from the rules of GM(see e.g. [9] for an overview of these classical concepts).\\nWhen looking at virtual machines grammars, we can identify two types of terminal symbols in\\nGM: the predeﬁned constants of the language LMand the variables. The predeﬁned constants are\\nthe keywords of the language, the predeﬁned symbols that are interpreted by Mupon execution\\nof a program, while the variables specify values, variable names etc.\\nAssume that an application makes use of such a machine M. That is, the application produces\\na program precognized by GMand sends ptoMfor execution. Assume moreover that pis at least\\npartially produced at runtime, based in part on some user provided input ip. We say that there\\nis a command injection vulnerability (more precisely in that case, an LM-injection vulnerability)if for some inputs ip, the application produces a pcontaining an element from ipthat is going to\\nbe recognized as a predeﬁned constant of the language LMby the grammar GM.\\nDeﬁnition 1 ( LM-injection vulnerability) An application has an LM-injection vulnerability\\nif\\n1. The application uses a virtual machine M.\\n2. It is possible for a user to provide a set of inputs ipto the application that will cause the\\napplication to pass a program ptoM.\\n3. There are in psome elements coming from ipthat will be parsed by the grammar GMas a\\npredeﬁned constant of the language LM.\\nAs Deﬁnition 1 speciﬁes, a command injection vulnerability is a ﬂaw that allows a user, poten-\\ntially malicious, to modify the parsed input of a virtual machine in such a way that the modiﬁed\\nportion of the input is going to be interpreted by the machine as a command. It is called a\\ncommand injection because it reﬂects the ability of the user to inject a “command” that will be\\nexecuted directly by the targeted virtual machine.\\nOur deﬁnition is in practice a bit too broad. Indeed, there are applications that intentionally\\nlet users “drive” some of the virtual machines used by the program, ideally in some limited and\\ncontrolled way. For example, there are numerous Web-based applications that let by design users\\nenter some HTML formatting instructions (such as bold, itemization etc.). Any such possibility\\nwould be ﬂagged as command-injection ﬂaw according to our deﬁnition. Clearly, if the application\\nis meant to allow such input, then this is not an injection “ﬂaw”, although it can still be a\\nsecurity vulnerability1. Our deﬁnition can easily be modiﬁed to account for “application expected\\nmodiﬁcations”, but we do not consider it in this paper for the sake of simplicity.\\nMost software applications make use of such virtual machines at runtime. In fact, a typical\\napplication will use several of these machines, used sometimes independently and sometimes in\\nsequence. Common examples include SQL engines, XML parsers, HTML parsers, scripting engines\\netc. Whenever an command injection vulnerability against a machine Mexists in an application,\\nthe attacker gets some level of control over the execution within M. In the following subsections,\\nwe review some of these injections attacks on practical examples.\\nSQL injections\\nAmong command injections, SQL injections are perhaps the best known and the most studied\\n(see e.g. [1, 2, 5, 8]). A SQL command injection vulnerability can exist whenever an application\\nuses a SQL based database and constructs unﬁltered (or improperly ﬁltered) SQL commands\\nbased on user input. An attacker can then take this opportunity to inject its own SQL command,\\nwhich will be passed down by the application to the SQL-database engine and executed.\\nThe archetype example of a code which presents SQL-injections vulnerabilities is the following\\ncode snippet, where a SQL query is being build on-the-ﬂy based on user provided user name and\\npassword:\\n1It should be noted that applications allowing directly this types of user-level manipulations can often be\\nmisused to allow unexpected command injections. See e.g. [3] for an example of possible consequences of allowing\\nan “<a href=. . . ” tag.LoginQuery = ’’SELECT * FROM UsersTable\\nWHERE UserId=’’’ +\\nrequest.getParameter(’’userName’’) +\\n’’’ AND Password = ’’’ +\\nrequest.getParameter(’’password’’) +\\n’’’;’’;\\nIn this code, “LoginQuery” is built based directly on user-provided inputs (parameters “user-\\nName” and “password”). The intent is to query the database to see if the table “UsersTable”\\ncontains a record where the ﬁeld “UserId” matches the user-provided parameter “userName” and\\nthe ﬁeld “Password” matches the user-provided parameter “password”.\\nBecause the query is built directly by concatenation of predeﬁned commands and user input,\\nmalicious users can actually modify the end query in various ways. For example, the password\\ncheck can be bypassed by providing a password such as ’ OR 1=1; . If the user name provided is\\nadministrator , this will turn the query “LoginQuery” into\\nSELECT * FROM UsersTable WHERE\\nUserId= ’administrator’\\nAND Password = ’’ OR 1=1;\\nThis command will always return the record with a ﬁeld UserId=’administrator’ , regardless\\nof the associated password value.\\nAnother way to manipulate the code above is to insert ’;in the user name or password, followed\\nby any SQL command. Again, this would lead to the execution of that user-provided command,\\nwhich can be any operation (table manipulation, database update etc.) permitted by the access\\nrights of the application on the database.\\nSQL-injections are clearly a particular case of our deﬁnition, where the virtual machine is the\\nSQL-based database engine, and the virtual machine language is SQL. As we can see from the\\nabove examples, an attacker will successfully perform a SQL injection by providing input that\\nwill be interpreted by the database as actual SQL (e.g. the ORin the example above).\\nHTML-browsers injections (HTML, XSS...)\\nHTML-browsers can be the target of several distinct command injections attacks. These in-\\njections where at ﬁrst not really considered harmful since they do not harm the system running\\nthe application in an obvious way; indeed, the application is not what is attacked, it is merely a\\nvector used to send attacks down to the HTML-browsers of the users of the application.\\nWe again consider a trivial example: assume that the application produces an HTML page con-\\ntaining user-provided comments to be displayed in other user’s HTML browsers. These comments\\nare typically stored in a database by another part of the application. Assume that the application\\nhas fetched an existing comment from the database, and stored the user name and comment into\\ntheUsername and Comment variables. Assume that the HTML page showing the user-provided\\ncomments is built from the following server side ASP code:\\n<B><%UserName%></B> says <%Comment%>If a malicious user has given a user name or a comment that include HTML tags, then those\\ntags will be inserted into the resulting page as is and will be directly interpreted by the HTML\\nbrowser of the users viewing the page. This is an example of an HTML-injection, and again\\nclearly a particular case of our general deﬁnition: the virtual machine is the HTML-browser and\\nthe language is HTML. A malicious user successfully attacks such a system by injecting data that\\nwill be interpreted as HTML by the HTML grammar. This can for example be the insertion of a\\nfake login form looking like the one of the application, which lies within a legitimate page of the\\napplication but sends the credential to some other location, controlled by the attacker.\\nIn addition to HTML-injections, HTML-browsers typically have embedded scripting interpreters\\n(such as JavaScript) that can be triggered from within an HTML page. Consider the same example\\nabove, but now with a malicious user entering a comment such as:\\n<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>\\nThis would lead to an HTML-page being created by the application with the JavaScript in-\\nstruction embedded in it, and thus again been interpreted by the HTML-browsers of subsequent\\nusers. This type of attack, known as “cross-site scripting”, or “XSS” [7, 4, 6], can be very serious,\\nsince a successful malicious attacker can get access to the scripting engines embedded into the\\napplication’s users’ HTML-browser, and for example get a hold on their “cookies”, which typically\\nlead to session hijacking. In our model, the virtual machine is the script interpreter embedded\\ninto the HTML-browser, and a successful attack consists of injecting data that will be interpreted\\nas script instructions (JavaScript in our example) by the interpreter. In the example, the injection\\ndid in fact trigger the invocation of the virtual machine, but of course similar example can be\\nconstructed where command injections happen within the scripting engine itself.\\nShell command injections\\nShell command injections vulnerabilities have been historically very important, although they\\nseem to be in decline lately. This type of command injections occurs when the application invokes\\nthe operating system shell (C-shell, Bash etc. on Unix, command shell on Windows etc.) to\\ninitiate another program. For example, the application could be sending an email, and for that\\ncould be using directly the “mail” program under Unix; or, it could be attempting to print with\\nthe “lpr” command. If, as part of this program invocation, the application is using some user\\ndata without proper ﬁltering, then again a malicious user can craft an input that will terminate\\nthe intended command and start another one of the user’s choice.\\nThis type of vulnerabilities used to be very common, presumably due to the Unix philosophy\\nof “piping” applications together and of invoking programs from the command line. Of course,\\na successful shell command injection is potentially catastrophic, since the attacker gets an access\\nto the operating system with the credential of the application.\\nShell command injections are also a particular case of our command injection deﬁnition, where\\nthe virtual machine is the shell itself.\\nOther injections\\nOther types of command injections have been reported: LDAP-injection, XPath injection, XML\\ninjection, macro injection etc. More importantly, there are going to be new types of commandinjections in the future, based on currently unknown technology. All of these types of attack are\\nvariation on the same pattern, so we must develop a defense strategy that is not based on the\\nspeciﬁcity of any given technology.\\nCommands injections versus commands modiﬁcations\\nOne limitation of our deﬁnition and of the strategy described below is that it addresses command\\ninjections vulnerabilities, but does not address command modiﬁcation vulnerabilities. A command\\nmodiﬁcation attack consists of a malicious user modifying a legitimate command to transform it\\ninto an illegitimate one, but without inserting any new instructions. For example, in the case of\\nSQL engines, it would mean to use an existing SELECT command to read diﬀerent records than\\nthe ones intended, or to use a legitimate DELETE command to delete records that should not have\\nbeen deleted.

Non- terminal symbols can be on both sides of the grammar’s derivation rules, while terminal symbols can only appear on the right hand side of these rules. A word of LMis made of terminal symbols and can be derived from the rules of GM(see e.g. [9] for an overview of these classical concepts). When looking at virtual machines grammars, we can identify two types of terminal symbols in GM: the predeﬁned constants of the language LMand the variables. The predeﬁned constants are the keywords of the language, the predeﬁned symbols that are interpreted by Mupon execution of a program, while the variables specify values, variable names etc. Assume that an application makes use of such a machine M. That is, the application produces a program precognized by GMand sends ptoMfor execution. Assume moreover that pis at least partially produced at runtime, based in part on some user provided input ip. We say that there is a command injection vulnerability (more precisely in that case, an LM-injection vulnerability)if for some inputs ip, the application produces a pcontaining an element from ipthat is going to be recognized as a predeﬁned constant of the language LMby the grammar GM. Deﬁnition 1 ( LM-injection vulnerability) An application has an LM-injection vulnerability if 1. The application uses a virtual machine M. 2. It is possible for a user to provide a set of inputs ipto the application that will cause the application to pass a program ptoM. 3. There are in psome elements coming from ipthat will be parsed by the grammar GMas a predeﬁned constant of the language LM. As Deﬁnition 1 speciﬁes, a command injection vulnerability is a ﬂaw that allows a user, poten- tially malicious, to modify the parsed input of a virtual machine in such a way that the modiﬁed portion of the input is going to be interpreted by the machine as a command. It is called a command injection because it reﬂects the ability of the user to inject a “command” that will be executed directly by the targeted virtual machine. Our deﬁnition is in practice a bit too broad. Indeed, there are applications that intentionally let users “drive” some of the virtual machines used by the program, ideally in some limited and controlled way. For example, there are numerous Web-based applications that let by design users enter some HTML formatting instructions (such as bold, itemization etc.). Any such possibility would be ﬂagged as command-injection ﬂaw according to our deﬁnition. Clearly, if the application is meant to allow such input, then this is not an injection “ﬂaw”, although it can still be a security vulnerability1. Our deﬁnition can easily be modiﬁed to account for “application expected modiﬁcations”, but we do not consider it in this paper for the sake of simplicity. Most software applications make use of such virtual machines at runtime. In fact, a typical application will use several of these machines, used sometimes independently and sometimes in sequence. Common examples include SQL engines, XML parsers, HTML parsers, scripting engines etc. Whenever an command injection vulnerability against a machine Mexists in an application, the attacker gets some level of control over the execution within M. In the following subsections, we review some of these injections attacks on practical examples. SQL injections Among command injections, SQL injections are perhaps the best known and the most studied (see e.g. [1, 2, 5, 8]). A SQL command injection vulnerability can exist whenever an application uses a SQL based database and constructs unﬁltered (or improperly ﬁltered) SQL commands based on user input. An attacker can then take this opportunity to inject its own SQL command, which will be passed down by the application to the SQL-database engine and executed. The archetype example of a code which presents SQL-injections vulnerabilities is the following code snippet, where a SQL query is being build on-the-ﬂy based on user provided user name and password: 1It should be noted that applications allowing directly this types of user-level manipulations can often be misused to allow unexpected command injections. See e.g. [3] for an example of possible consequences of allowing an “<a href=. . . ” tag.LoginQuery = ’’SELECT * FROM UsersTable WHERE UserId=’’’ + request.getParameter(’’userName’’) + ’’’ AND Password = ’’’ + request.getParameter(’’password’’) + ’’’;’’; In this code, “LoginQuery” is built based directly on user-provided inputs (parameters “user- Name” and “password”). The intent is to query the database to see if the table “UsersTable” contains a record where the ﬁeld “UserId” matches the user-provided parameter “userName” and the ﬁeld “Password” matches the user-provided parameter “password”. Because the query is built directly by concatenation of predeﬁned commands and user input, malicious users can actually modify the end query in various ways. For example, the password check can be bypassed by providing a password such as ’ OR 1=1; . If the user name provided is administrator , this will turn the query “LoginQuery” into SELECT * FROM UsersTable WHERE UserId= ’administrator’ AND Password = ’’ OR 1=1; This command will always return the record with a ﬁeld UserId=’administrator’ , regardless of the associated password value. Another way to manipulate the code above is to insert ’;in the user name or password, followed by any SQL command. Again, this would lead to the execution of that user-provided command, which can be any operation (table manipulation, database update etc.) permitted by the access rights of the application on the database. SQL-injections are clearly a particular case of our deﬁnition, where the virtual machine is the SQL-based database engine, and the virtual machine language is SQL. As we can see from the above examples, an attacker will successfully perform a SQL injection by providing input that will be interpreted by the database as actual SQL (e.g. the ORin the example above). HTML-browsers injections (HTML, XSS...) HTML-browsers can be the target of several distinct command injections attacks. These in- jections where at ﬁrst not really considered harmful since they do not harm the system running the application in an obvious way; indeed, the application is not what is attacked, it is merely a vector used to send attacks down to the HTML-browsers of the users of the application. We again consider a trivial example: assume that the application produces an HTML page con- taining user-provided comments to be displayed in other user’s HTML browsers. These comments are typically stored in a database by another part of the application. Assume that the application has fetched an existing comment from the database, and stored the user name and comment into theUsername and Comment variables. Assume that the HTML page showing the user-provided comments is built from the following server side ASP code: <B><%UserName%></B> says <%Comment%>If a malicious user has given a user name or a comment that include HTML tags, then those tags will be inserted into the resulting page as is and will be directly interpreted by the HTML browser of the users viewing the page. This is an example of an HTML-injection, and again clearly a particular case of our general deﬁnition: the virtual machine is the HTML-browser and the language is HTML. A malicious user successfully attacks such a system by injecting data that will be interpreted as HTML by the HTML grammar. This can for example be the insertion of a fake login form looking like the one of the application, which lies within a legitimate page of the application but sends the credential to some other location, controlled by the attacker. In addition to HTML-injections, HTML-browsers typically have embedded scripting interpreters (such as JavaScript) that can be triggered from within an HTML page. Consider the same example above, but now with a malicious user entering a comment such as: <script>alert(document.cookie)</script> This would lead to an HTML-page being created by the application with the JavaScript in- struction embedded in it, and thus again been interpreted by the HTML-browsers of subsequent users. This type of attack, known as “cross-site scripting”, or “XSS” [7, 4, 6], can be very serious, since a successful malicious attacker can get access to the scripting engines embedded into the application’s users’ HTML-browser, and for example get a hold on their “cookies”, which typically lead to session hijacking. In our model, the virtual machine is the script interpreter embedded into the HTML-browser, and a successful attack consists of injecting data that will be interpreted as script instructions (JavaScript in our example) by the interpreter. In the example, the injection did in fact trigger the invocation of the virtual machine, but of course similar example can be constructed where command injections happen within the scripting engine itself. Shell command injections Shell command injections vulnerabilities have been historically very important, although they seem to be in decline lately. This type of command injections occurs when the application invokes the operating system shell (C-shell, Bash etc. on Unix, command shell on Windows etc.) to initiate another program. For example, the application could be sending an email, and for that could be using directly the “mail” program under Unix; or, it could be attempting to print with the “lpr” command. If, as part of this program invocation, the application is using some user data without proper ﬁltering, then again a malicious user can craft an input that will terminate the intended command and start another one of the user’s choice. This type of vulnerabilities used to be very common, presumably due to the Unix philosophy of “piping” applications together and of invoking programs from the command line. Of course, a successful shell command injection is potentially catastrophic, since the attacker gets an access to the operating system with the credential of the application. Shell command injections are also a particular case of our command injection deﬁnition, where the virtual machine is the shell itself. Other injections Other types of command injections have been reported: LDAP-injection, XPath injection, XML injection, macro injection etc. More importantly, there are going to be new types of commandinjections in the future, based on currently unknown technology. All of these types of attack are variation on the same pattern, so we must develop a defense strategy that is not based on the speciﬁcity of any given technology. Commands injections versus commands modiﬁcations One limitation of our deﬁnition and of the strategy described below is that it addresses command injections vulnerabilities, but does not address command modiﬁcation vulnerabilities. A command modiﬁcation attack consists of a malicious user modifying a legitimate command to transform it into an illegitimate one, but without inserting any new instructions. For example, in the case of SQL engines, it would mean to use an existing SELECT command to read diﬀerent records than the ones intended, or to use a legitimate DELETE command to delete records that should not have been deleted. This type of attack is no less harmful than a command injection. It basically follows the same pattern but is not captured by Deﬁnition 1. In fact, we argue that command modiﬁcation ﬂaws are of a diﬀerent type entirely. When a command is “modiﬁed” in an application, it is the semantics of the application itself that is being abused. A purely syntactic approach such as the one proposed against command injections ﬂaws is not appropriate for such a problem. It does not mean that this type of ﬂaw can be overlooked, but rather that it will only be caught by an analysis of the inner workings of the application, much like the other security-related bugs in the application.

Tech. and Engineering University of Ottawa 800 King Edward Avenue Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, K1N 6N5 gvj@site.uottawa.ca Command injections In this section, we ﬁrst deﬁne formally what a command injection vulnerability is, and we then provide several examples of diﬀerent types of command injections chosen among the most common ones at the time of writing. Formal deﬁnition of command injections Command injections vulnerabilities are common and occur with diﬀerent technologies, current and future. In order to grasp the essence of the problem, we propose here a deﬁnition of command injections which is technology independent. Assume that we have a virtual machine Mthat accepts programs as input and “executes” these programs in some way. As it is customary with virtual machines, in order to be executed, the programs must be “valid”, in that they have to be an element of the input language LMrecognized byM. The language LMis usually speciﬁed by a grammar GM. Thus, a valid program for a machine Mis a program recognized by the grammar GM. The grammar GMhas two types of symbols: the terminal and the non-terminal symbols.
